# Config for workstyle
#
# Format:
# "pattern" = "icon"
#
# The pattern will be used to match against the application name, class_id or WM_CLASS.
# The icon will be used to represent that application.
#
# Note if multiple patterns are present in the same application name,
# precedence is given in order of apparition in this file.

# Sometimes icons are prepended with "\u200e" in order to prevent reversed icons: https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/workstyle/issues/38
